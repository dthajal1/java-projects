# Number Guessing Game

## TODO
- Your program should generate a secret (random) number between 1 to 100 and tell the user to guess that number (Hint: there are java libraries that can do this)
- When the user enters the guess, your program should be able to take that input from the user and output on the terminal whether the guess was correct, less than the secret number or greater than the secret number 
- If the guess was less than or greater than the secret number, your program should tell the user whether their output was less/greater than and let the user guess again
- If the guess was correct, then program should ends with a congrats message

## Things you will learn
- random number generation
- taking the input from the user and making use of the user's input
- binary search algorithm (you will probably learn this in your data structure course)
